Contact Management System

This Windows Forms application, developed in C#, provides an efficient and user-friendly way to manage a contact list. The application connects to a SQL Server database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contact records. It uses ClosedXML for exporting contact lists to Excel. Key features include:

Add New Contact: Users can add a new contact by entering the ID, Name, Phone, and Email. The application validates the ID to ensure it's an integer before saving the new contact to the database.

Update Existing Contact: Users can update the details of an existing contact by providing the ID along with the new Name, Phone, and Email information.

Delete Contact: Users can delete a contact by entering the ID of the contact they wish to remove.

Search Contact by ID: Users can search for a specific contact by entering its ID. The search results are displayed in a DataGridView.

Display All Contacts: Users can view all contacts stored in the database. The contact list is displayed in a DataGridView.

Export to Excel: Users can export the contact list to an Excel file using the ClosedXML library. The exported file can be saved to a user-defined location.
